Convert your users with targeted pop-ups. Use triggers & rules to nudge your users towards conversions when they\'re ready using the perfect pop-up.

== Description ==
PopBot helps you increase your conversion rates by delivering key pop-up messages when your users are ready to convert. Use Gutenberg to build on top of our specialised pop-up templates and our customisable triggers and conditions to perfectly target your users.

= Fully Customisable Appearance =
All out pop-ups are fully customisable, allowing you to choose from a range of mobile-friendly pop-up templates. Then you can build on top of them with the block editor, meaning PopBot supports a wide range of block plugins out of the box.

= Target User Behaviour =
With customisable triggers, you can ensure you pop-ups only show when the users is ready to convert. Use scroll depth, form submission, click events, time on site, and more to target your users when they\'re primed to convert.

= Focus using Conditions =
Conditions allow you to focus your pop-ups to be specialised to specific users & pages. PopBot supports a wide range of useful values you can target out of the box like URLs, devices, user journey and time. If that\'s not enough, our powerful Custom Conditions system allows you to create any condition you can imagine. With PopBot, your pop-ups will always be relevant to each visitor.

= Flexible Scheduling =
You can set start & end dates for your pop-up to become visible on your site and specify what users can see your PopBot. Hide your pop-up, make it visible to admins or visible to everyone.

= Analytics Built-in =
We automatically track how well your pop-ups are performing so you can make informed decisions on how you to push your conversion rate even further.
